# TowerDefencePrototype

Simple Tower defence prototype. Castle to protect, monsters to be killed, towers to shoot and stuff

Results at the moment:
1. 2 basic and 2 upgraded types of towers. 
2. 3 basic and 3 elite types of monsters
3. 4 hardcore levels (creating easy levels is too hard)
4. Easy way too modify monster waves in Unity inspector
5. Sort of testing-friendly structure here and there... but not everywhere

TODO plans:
1. Tutorial or good design of new first levels. Now even possibility of tower upgrading is not obvious.
2. Better inteface (in UX sense)
3. Multispawn levels
4. More types of towers
5. New monsters and better and more complicated AI
6. More levels, obviously
