# TowerDefencePrototype
Nore: prototype was rebuilt and continued on closed repository.

Simple Tower defence prototype. Castle to protect, monsters to be killed, towers to shoot and stuff.

Results at the moment:
1. 2 basic and 2 upgraded types of towers. 
2. 3 basic and 3 elite types of monsters
3. 4 hardcore levels (creating easy levels is too hard)
4. Easy way too modify monster waves in Unity inspector
5. Sort of testing-friendly structure here and there... but not everywhere
